# AutomaticStreetLightControlSystem-
This repository contains the source code and documentation for an Automatic Street Light Control System. The purpose of this project is to design and implement an intelligent system that automatically controls street lights based on the surrounding lighting conditions. 

Features

Automatic On/Off: The system uses sensors to detect ambient lighting conditions and automatically turns on or off the street lights accordingly.
Intelligent Control: The control algorithm adjusts the brightness of the street lights based on the level of darkness in the surroundings, ensuring adequate illumination while minimizing energy wastage.
Time-based Scheduling: The system can be programmed to operate according to predefined time schedules. For example, the lights can be set to turn on at sunset and turn off at sunrise.

Prerequisites

Before using the Automatic Street Light Control System, the following prerequisites should be met:
Microcontroller board (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) with appropriate sensors and actuators.
Development environment and toolchain set up for the chosen microcontroller.
Required libraries and dependencies installed.
